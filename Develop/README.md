  ## Description

  This command-line application is designed to generate a README.md file based on user input. It may not cover all needs for every project, but it will save time laying the framework. This was an excellent excersize for getting to som eof the node.js and inquirer basics.

  ## Usage

  To use please open the integrated console and run the command 'npm i'. You can then continue to rewrite the test README for other projects by running the 'node index.js' command in the command-line.

  ## Credits

  This project was made with the assistance of my tutor Megan Meyers. I may have been able to complete the project with similar functionality but she made the code much cleaner and easier to understand. She specifically helped me with writing the function format that says !== '' - so if the response isn't blank then print x, otherwise give an empty string. It allowed for much more concise coding than I would have originally written.
