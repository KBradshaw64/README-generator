## Description

This project is designed to help streamline the creation of a README file based on user input. Even if this framework does not cover everything needed in a specific README, it will still cover the basics to save time and effort. This project is a good way to familiarize yourself with the basics of node.js and inquirer.

## Usage

To use the program please run 'npm i' in the integrated console in order to install inquirer. The file can be rerun with a new README overwritten each time by typing 'node index.js' in the integrated console.

## Credits

This project *might* been possible without the help of my tutor Megan Myers, though it would have been much sloppier code and it would have taken hours longer. Huge thanks to her.
