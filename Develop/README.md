  ## Description

  This project is deigned to help streamline the creation of a README file based on user input. The framework may not provide all the details for every project but it will get you started and save time/effort. It was also a great way to familiarize myself with the basics of node.js and inquirer.

  ## Usage

  To use, you will need to open the integrated console and run 'npm i' in order to install inquirer. From there you can run the command 'node index.js' and rewrite the created READMEfile.

  ## Credits

  This project was made with the assistance of my tutor Megan Myers. Without her help the application would have been much messier and have taken much longer to create! Huge thank you to her.
